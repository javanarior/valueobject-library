# Release Notes




## 0.2.0 (2014-09-07)
- In AbstractValue a #toString Method is added. It prints the implementing class and the value.
- The metaType parameter was removed. It was not necessary and simplifies the API. On the other
  hand this change breaks backward compatibility.

## 0.1.0 (2014-08-17)
- Initial release.
